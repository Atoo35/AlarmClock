# Alarmclock

This alarm clock is developed on Android Studio for Android devices.
The app contains normal stopwatch and timer functionalities as required by any clock app.


Unique point is that the alarm can be snoozed by shaking the phone (Shake gesture detection using accelerometer), snooze time is set by the user.
Also the alarm can be stopped by the user by waving hand over the phone (Wave gesture detection using proximity sensor).
There are animations to shake and wave when the alarm buzzes.
